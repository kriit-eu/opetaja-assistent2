## 1. Introduction

### Project Purpose and Scope

**Õpetaja Assistent 2** is a browser extension designed to enhance the functionality of the Tahvel educational platform used in Estonian schools. The extension provides automation tools, data synchronization capabilities, and improved user interfaces to streamline teacher workflows and reduce manual administrative tasks.

**Key Objectives:**

- Automate repetitive tasks in the Tahvel educational platform
- Synchronize data between Tahvel and external systems (primarily Kriit)
- Provide enhanced data visualization and reporting capabilities
- Reduce manual effort and minimize data entry errors
- Improve teacher productivity and workflow efficiency

**Project Scope:**

- Browser extension compatible with Chromium-based browsers
- Integration with Tahvel educational platform (https://tahvel.edu.ee)
- Integration with Kriit system for assignment management
- Support for multiple journal management workflows
- Real-time data synchronization and validation
- Extensible architecture for future feature additions

### Background and Current Situation

The Estonian educational system relies heavily on the Tahvel platform for journal management, student tracking, and academic administration. Teachers often need to work with multiple systems simultaneously, leading to:

- **Data Redundancy**: Manual entry of the same information across multiple platforms
- **Synchronization Issues**: Inconsistencies between different educational systems
- **Time-Consuming Processes**: Repetitive tasks that could be automated
- **Error-Prone Workflows**: Manual processes prone to human error
- **Limited Visualization**: Lack of comprehensive overview tools

The original "Õpetaja Assistent" provided basic functionality, but this second version represents a complete architectural redesign with modern web technologies and expanded capabilities.

### Stakeholders and Target Group

## 3. Business Needs and Context

### Problem Description

**Current Challenges:**

1. **Manual Data Entry**: Teachers must enter the same information multiple times across different systems
2. **Data Inconsistency**: Lack of real-time synchronization leads to conflicting information
3. **Time-Consuming Workflows**: Repetitive administrative tasks consume valuable teaching time
4. **Limited Overview**: No comprehensive view of student progress across multiple journals
5. **Error-Prone Processes**: Manual data entry increases risk of human errors
6. **System Fragmentation**: Multiple disconnected systems requiring separate logins and workflows

**Impact on Users:**

- Reduced time available for actual teaching activities

6. Compares grades between systems manually
7. Resolves discrepancies by updating both systems
8. Generates reports from both systems separately

**Enhanced Workflow (With Extension):**

1. Teacher logs into Tahvel system (extension activates automatically)
2. Extension displays sync status and discrepancies immediately
3. Teacher creates assignment in Tahvel
4. Extension automatically syncs assignment to Kriit
